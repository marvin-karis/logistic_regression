Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used for classification tasks, such as predicting whether a football team will win, lose or draw.In this code we are using scikit-learn library to perform logistic regression on football match data obtained from an API.
Here's a high-level overview of how you could use logistic regression to predict the probability of a team winning a football match:

Collect data: Gather a dataset of past football matches, including the team names, the date of the match, and the final score.

Preprocess the data: Convert the team names into numerical features using a technique like one-hot encoding. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train the model: Train a logistic regression model on the training data, using the team names and other relevant features (e.g., home/away advantage, player statistics, etc.) as input.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing data, using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Predict new outcomes: Use the trained model to predict the probability of one team winning a new football match, based on the input features
